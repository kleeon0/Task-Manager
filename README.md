# projects

A program that allows users to record tasks to complete. Tasks can be managed based on criteria such as: priority, time needed to complete the task, and deadline. Or the user can set a
repeating task for reviewing and memorising certain skills and information. Creating tasks will set up a list of tasks that will be assigned to remind the user to complete them on a given day. On days where there is a task due, the user will have to set up a countdown timer, which they will have to complete.
